## What it does

`setup-matt-pocock-skills` answers three questions about one repo: where issues live, what the triage labels are called, and where the domain docs sit. It records the answers as markdown files under `docs/agents/`.

Those files hold each repo's skill configuration. The skills themselves are identical everywhere. They read `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` at run time and do what it says. That is why the set is not tied to GitHub, and why you never edit a skill file to point it at another tracker. Invoking it with "link the skills to a custom issue tracker" works with anything you can connect to programmatically, with no changes to the skills.

It is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. It reads your `git remote`, `CLAUDE.md` and `GLOSSARY.md`, proposes what it found, and confirms the setup choices with you.

## When to reach for it

Type `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`, or the agent can invoke it when the task fits. The setup draft and its consequential choices still require the user’s confirmation.

Reach for it once per repo, before the first use of any other engineering skill. If [triage](https://aihero.dev/skills-triage), [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec), [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) or [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder) start guessing where your issues go, or apply labels your tracker doesn't have, this repo has not been set up yet. You can run it in a repo halfway through a project. The skill reads what is already there, so no earlier work is lost.

## Prerequisites

It writes into the repo you run it in:

| It writes | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `issue-tracker.md` | `docs/agents/` |
| `domain.md` | `docs/agents/` |
| `triage-labels.md` | `docs/agents/`, only when the `triage` skill is installed |
| An `## Agent skills` block | whichever of `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` already exists |

You commit all of it as markdown. There is no user-level or global mode. The config lives in the repo, so every repo gets its own copy.

## The three decisions

It starts each section with the recommended answer, and skips any question its exploration already answered. Most runs need only two confirmations.

| Decision | What it proposes | When it asks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Issue tracker** | the one matching your `git remote` | always, because this is the one real choice |
| **Triage labels** | keep the five canonical names (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`) | only if the `triage` skill is installed |
| **Domain docs** | single-context: one `GLOSSARY.md` plus `docs/adr/` at the root | only if it spots monorepo signals, and then it offers a multi-context `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` |

The tracker options:

| Option | Where issues live | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GitHub** | the repo's GitHub Issues | the `gh` CLI |
| **GitLab** | the repo's GitLab Issues | the `glab` CLI |
| **Local markdown** | files under `.scratch/<feature>/` in this repo | nothing, not even a remote |
| **Other** | wherever you say | one paragraph from you describing the workflow |

The first three ship as templates in the skill and work out of the box. Local markdown is a full option, not a fallback. The skill supports a solo project with no remote. One caveat: don't use local markdown if you use GitHub. They are alternatives, so pick one.

If you choose GitHub or GitLab, the agent confirms the exact project and checks that `gh` or `glab` can resolve it. If no remote points to that host, it asks for the repository URL, initializes Git if needed, and adds a remote under an unused name. Existing remotes are preserved. The tracker instructions then target the confirmed project explicitly. If the check fails, setup stops and explains what is missing.

If a legacy context map exists, setup can offer a migration of the map and its mapped context glossaries. It shows the proposed file moves and reference updates for your confirmation, and stops on unsafe paths or destination conflicts instead of overwriting files.

The GitHub and GitLab templates keep PR/MR discovery off by default. Enabling discovery does not authorize execution: `triage` requires disposable isolation before checking out or running contributed code, and records checks as not run when isolation is unavailable. Existing tracker configs can carry the same reminder when you refresh them.

"Other" is a full option too. It is how Jira, Linear, Azure DevOps and Beads all work. You describe the workflow, the skill records your prose in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, and the downstream skills follow the prose. Users have already built this: a Jira-over-[MCP](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/mcp) variant, a Gitea CLI shaped like `gh`, a hand-built local dashboard.

## Common questions

**Do I have to use GitHub?**

No. GitHub, GitLab and local markdown under `.scratch/` all ship as ready-made templates, and anything else works through the "other" path. This is the most-repeated question, in roughly these words: *"hard locked to github"*, *"can I use GitLab / Jira"*, *"what about Azure DevOps"*. The answer is always the same: setup chooses the tracker, not the skill.

**Do I need to re-run it after updating the skills?**

The direct answer after v1.1 was yes. The skill's own closing message is softer. It tells you to re-run only to switch trackers or start over. Both are defensible. The seed templates change between versions, so a `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` from an older release can go out of date against the skills that now read it. If a downstream skill does something different from what the docs describe, re-run setup. It is cheap.

**It wrote to `CLAUDE.md`, but I'm on Codex.**

This is a known gap, and still open. The file-selection rule is "edit `CLAUDE.md` if it exists, else `AGENTS.md`". It checks which file exists, not which [harness](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/harness) is running. In a repo with a `CLAUDE.md` left over from Claude Code, the skill writes its `## Agent skills` block to a file Codex never reads. Users have two workarounds: move the block to `AGENTS.md` by hand, or keep `AGENTS.md` canonical and make `CLAUDE.md` a one-line pointer at it. If neither file exists, the skill asks you which to create instead of picking one. This has confused people who expected it to decide.

**It didn't create my triage labels.**

When `triage` is installed and you choose GitHub or GitLab, setup records the selected triage-label mapping and creates any configured labels missing from the tracker. If `triage` is not installed, setup skips the mapping and label creation.

Wayfinder's `wayfinder:map` and `wayfinder:<type>` labels are separate; setup does not create them. Create those labels before using wayfinder with a tracker that requires labels to exist first.

**Can I configure the other skills' behaviour here ([grilling](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/grilling) cadence, question format, tone)?**

No. It configures three things: tracker, labels, doc layout. Users have asked to make it the place for per-user preferences. The answer is that skills stay opinionated and take no per-user config. Preferences belong in your `CLAUDE.md` as plain instructions, which every skill already reads.

**Can I keep the config in `~/.claude` instead of committing it to every repo?**

Not today. A user who runs the skills across many repos has an open request for this, but no user-level mode exists. Every repo carries its own `docs/agents/`.

**Isn't it strange to have a skill that configures the other skills?**

One long-standing complaint says yes, in these words: *"having a skill to set up the other skill does not feel right to me: that means the LLM is configuring its own skills."* The trade-off is real. Without a setup step, every skill that touches issues would need its own copy of the tracker instructions. The output is markdown you can read and edit, and that limits the risk. You can read every file it wrote and change it by hand. Make day-to-day changes that way, not with another run.

## It's working if

- `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` and `docs/agents/domain.md` exist, plus `triage-labels.md` if `triage` is installed.
- An `## Agent skills` section appears in the instruction file your harness reads, with a one-line summary pointing at each of those files.
- The tracker it proposed matches the remote you use, and the label strings match labels that exist in your tracker.
- Afterwards, `/to-tickets` publishes without asking you where issues live, and `/triage` applies labels rather than inventing them.
- Nothing in the skill files themselves changed. If setup edited a `SKILL.md`, something went wrong.

## Where it fits

`setup-matt-pocock-skills` is the **run-once setup** for the engineering flow, the precondition everything else assumes rather than a step in the chain. Its neighbours are its readers: [triage](https://aihero.dev/skills-triage), which applies the label vocabulary written here; [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec) and [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), which publish into the tracker named here; and [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder), which reads the "Wayfinding operations" section of the same tracker file to learn how to store maps and child [tickets](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/ticket). [domain-modeling](https://aihero.dev/skills-domain-modeling) later fills in the domain-doc layout that setup records. It creates `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs only when you resolve a term or decision, so a repo with no domain docs after setup is normal. For which skill to reach for next, [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes the whole set.
