Skills are organized into bucket folders under `skills/`:

- `engineering/`: daily code work
- `productivity/`: daily non-code workflow tools
- `misc/`: kept around but rarely used, not promoted
- `in-progress/`: beta: public on purpose, feedback wanted, not shipped in the plugin
- `deprecated/`: no longer used

Every skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/` (the **promoted** buckets) must have a reference in the top-level `README.md` and an entry in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `skills` array (the Claude Code plugin ships exactly the promoted set). Skills in `misc/`, `in-progress/`, and `deprecated/` must not appear in either.

Install commands are copied verbatim from [.agents/install-block.md](./.agents/install-block.md). `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` makes the repo its own single-plugin marketplace (a fallback the install block explains, not the documented route). Run `claude plugin validate . --strict` after touching either manifest. Why a Claude plugin but not (yet) a Codex one lives in [.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md](./.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md).

Each skill entry in the top-level `README.md` must link the skill name to its `SKILL.md`.

Each bucket folder has a `README.md` that lists every skill in the bucket with a one-line description, with the skill name linked to its `SKILL.md`. The promoted buckets' `README.md`s and the top-level `README.md` group entries into **User-invoked** and **Model-invoked**; non-promoted bucket `README.md`s (`misc/`, `in-progress/`) use a flat list.

Skills in `engineering/` and `productivity/` also have a human-facing docs page at `docs/<bucket>/<skill-name>.md` (the docs tree mirrors those two bucket folders under `skills/`). The published URL is `https://aihero.dev/skills-<skill-name>` regardless of bucket: the docs path is repo organisation only. When you add, rename, or change the behaviour of a skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/`, create or re-sync its docs page following [.agents/writing-docs.md](./.agents/writing-docs.md). A finished page carries four sections: **What it does**, **When to reach for it**, **Common questions**, and **It's working if**. `writing-docs.md` holds the template, the section order, and where to hunt for the questions. Skills in the non-promoted buckets (`misc/`, `in-progress/`, `deprecated/`) get **no** docs page. The one exception is a promoted skill removed outright: its page stays, marked archived (see `writing-docs.md`).

Every `SKILL.md` is either user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true` plus `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`, reachable only by the human) or model-invoked (model- or user-reachable). See [.agents/invocation.md](./.agents/invocation.md).

[`ask-matt`](./skills/engineering/ask-matt/SKILL.md) is the router that maps every user-reachable skill and how they relate. The same trigger that re-syncs a docs page applies to it: whenever you add, rename, remove, or change how a user-reachable skill fits the flows, re-read `ask-matt`'s `SKILL.md` and update it so the map stays accurate: a new skill it never mentions, or a stale one it still routes to, is a router that lies.

To (re)link every skill outside `deprecated/` and `misc/` into the local harness skill directories (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`), run `scripts/link-skills.sh`. Each entry is a symlink into this repo, so a `git pull` keeps installed skills current; re-run the script after adding, removing, or renaming a skill.

No em-dashes anywhere in this repo's prose (`SKILL.md` files, docs, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, ADRs, changesets, code comments). Where a sentence reaches for one, rewrite it instead with a comma, colon, period, parentheses, or a conjunction, whichever the sentence actually wants; never do a blind character substitution.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Track this fork's packaging and maintenance work in `nisavid/mattpocock-skills` GitHub Issues. Read `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` before ticket operations.

### Triage labels

Canonical names, unchanged. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`. Use `SCOPE.md` for upstream skill changes; fork packaging and maintenance follow the fork operations guidance below.

### Domain docs

This repo has one domain context. Read `GLOSSARY.md` and relevant ADRs under `.agents/adr/`; see `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Fork operations

This fork distributes Matt Pocock's promoted engineering and productivity skills. Preserve attribution, the MIT license, and upstream skill bytes. Keep `AGENTS.md` as a symlink to this file.

Use `fork-ops` before upstream assessment, synchronization, or changes to fork operating policy. Read `.agents/fork-ops.toml` when present; when it is missing, prepare and review the initial configuration before dependent operations. Treat its capability report as evidence only for the named implemented operation.

Complete authorized, reversible repo work autonomously, preserving unrelated changes. Use `checkpointing-and-publishing-git-work` for task-owned commits and publication, and `publishing-reviewable-prs` for pull requests. Review code and configuration with Tricritical before shipping; substantive changes require its `loop`, independent critics, and independent adjudication on the final revision. Ordinary documentation outside protected paths follows the lighter repository review policy.

Stop for unresolved ownership, conflicts, failed required checks or reviews, unavailable authority, and consequential policy choices. Keep account, credential, permission, branch-protection, release, and publication changes within their specifically authorized scope.

Capture reusable packaging and synchronization procedures through `capturing-agent-procedures`. A consumer loads the maintained procedure and verifies its reviewed revision and required evidence before dependent execution.
